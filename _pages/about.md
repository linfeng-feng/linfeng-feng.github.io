I am working toward the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering with the Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China. Currently, I am working as an algorithm intern with the Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom. My research interests include spatial audio, speech enhancement, and multimodal learning.
